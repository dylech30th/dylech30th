### I'm Dylech30th, it's been a pleasure to meet you

我是Dylech30th，简短起见，你可以叫我*dc* | I'm Dylech30th, you can call me *dc* for brevity

<!-- <div align="center"><h2>「Relationships will only lower my integrity as a human」 —— Araragi Koyomi</h2></div>

* Despite of the Chuunibyou-esque quote above, I'm still willing to make friends, however, I prefer not to introduce myself since those who have such intentions will figure it out regardless of whether I'll do this comprehensively or not

* I'm a beginner (unambiguously, beginner stands for any definition of "beginner" you can find in a dictionary instead of some hypocritic humble non-sense words of which I mostly hated) at Theoretical Computer Science, particularly interest in Computablity/Computational Complexity Theory, Compiler Construction, and a rudimentary knowledge of Type Theory.

* I prefer fast, handy, and reliable productivity tools that only require occasional tuning, for example, VS[ Code]\(bracket for "optionality"\), ReSharper and Windows Terminal.

* All these are bullshits, usotsuki, forget'em.-->
