#### 🤠 A brief introduction to myself:

## I'm an extreme paranoia with sociopathic tendencies and highly efficient on finding ways to enrage and distrust myself, stay away from a piece of crap like me for your own good, no offense and no kidding

🗺️ Location: China🇨🇳

🏫 I'm a student who is

❤️‍🔥 passionate on:
* 🖥️ Computer Science
* ➕ Discrete Mathematics
* 💡  Modeling Computation
* 🔀 Compiler Theory

while I'm trying to walk into some new areas (not ever started yet though😝) such as: 

* 🍽️ Mathematical logic and Set theory
* 📖 Philosophy

💪 Currently, I am learning Discrete Mathematics and Theory of Compilation. Further plan is start learning Computer Architecture and CPU Architecture.
 
📝 I often share my experiences&opinions and notes on my blog: [dylech30th's blog](https://sora.ink), welcome to pay a visit and leave a comment, I'll treat it as the most valuable thing among the world 💖
 
😖 while I keep working on a few kinds of programming language and trying to get some improvements on code quality, I'm still a bitter hand on it, feel free to explore my projects, and try not to laugh when enjoying my "masterpieces"! 🤣

#### 🤔 What am I doing now?
* 🔭 I'm currently working on [**Pixeval**](https://github.com/dylech30th/Pixeval)'s reforge edition, which will use [WinUI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/winui/) and my favorite [Fluent Design](https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent/#/) as its UI framework!
* 🌱 I'm learning to be a *Minecraft Modder*! though I've never written any mods before, and I haven't even read Minecraft's source code yet
* 📚 Preparing for the examination! that's the most important thing over these years
* 🤒 Seasonal asthma! trying my best to cure myself!

#### 🎯 My Projects.
* 🖼️ [**Pixeval**](https://github.com/dylech30th/Pixeval). a powerful, fast, lightweight(?) third-party Pixiv client! You can explore its main functions at [here](https://sora.ink/archives/391)(be careful it's fully written in Simplified Chinese)
* 🤖 [**Sayaka**](https://github.com/dylech30th/sayaka). A QQ bot based on mirai framework, provides a set of functionality to get you excited♂ when chatting with your fri♂ends. However, it's still under development(so why should I put it in this section? just to fill the amount maybe?)
* 🌐 [sora.ink](https://sora.ink). My personal blog containing all what I want to share with you, and it's based on Wordpress with [Mashiro's Sakura theme](https://github.com/mashirozx/Sakura), which looks very nice and impressive.

#### 🍲 What else?
* 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on [Pixeval](https://github.com/dylech30th/Pixeval), if you're interested in this project or intend to make contributions, welcome to post a pull request or issue or contact me directly by joining QQ group [815791942](https://qm.qq.com/cgi-bin/qm/qr?k=7ZOYvFDzApWKE71whQ5dx01Mq4dvggrj&jump_from=webapi)(take the validation question seriously)
* 💬 You can ask me almost everything except personal questions! call me "dc" instead of "dylech30th" because it has no precise pronunciation and not meaningful(well it's generated by a random generator... you cannot expecting more)
* ⚡ Try to be nice with me! maybe you can find something more...

Starting with a Java programmer, but nowadays I'm more inclined to consider myself as a Kotlin/C# programmer for these are my most familiar languages! To be honest, I am not expert in programming for I'm actually obsess on something that is more theoratical like the the correspondence between programming language and its mathematical model(actually I'm just a starter of this domain, too). So suggestions are welcome! If you want to get closer to me, just leave a comment on my <a href="https://sora.ink">blog</a> or contact me throught those aforementioned methods
